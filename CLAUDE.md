# Pitching Model — Claude Agent Guide

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

---

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Project Overview

This project predicts pitcher performance stats for use in baseball betting throughout the season. Agents ingest historical and real-time pitching data, engineer features, run predictions via a trained model, and surface actionable betting signals.

### Key Directories
- `data/raw/` — Raw ingested data (gitignored)
- `data/processed/` — Cleaned and feature-engineered data (gitignored)
- `src/` — All Python source code and agent implementations
- `config/` — Settings and criteria YAML files
- `prompts/` — Claude API prompt templates
- `outputs/` — Predictions, reports, and bet logs (gitignored)
- `notebooks/` — EDA and exploratory Jupyter notebooks
- `tasks/` — Planning docs, todos, and lessons learned

### Running the Agent
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure settings
# Edit config/settings.yaml with your preferences

# Full run (TBD as architecture is defined)
python src/main.py
```

### Environment Setup
